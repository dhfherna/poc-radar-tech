Microfrontends,assess,techniques,FALSE,"<p>We've seen significant benefits from introducing <a href=""https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html"">microservices</a>, which have allowed teams to scale the delivery of independently deployed and maintained services. Unfortunately, we've also seen many teams create a frontend monolith — a large, entangled browser application that sits on top of the backend services — largely neutralizing the benefits of microservices. Since we first described <strong>micro frontends</strong> as a technique to address this issue, we've had almost universally positive experiences with the approach and have found a number of patterns to use micro frontends even as more and more code shifts from the server to the web browser.

Secrets as a service,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"<p>Humans and machines use secrets throughout the value stream of building and operating software. The build pipelines need secrets to interface with secure infrastructures such as container registries, the applications use API keys as secrets to get access to business capabilities, and the service-to-service communications are secured using certificates and keys as secrets. You can set and retrieve these secrets in different ways. We've long cautioned developers about using source code management for storing secrets. We've recommended <a href=""/radar/techniques/decoupling-secret-management-from-source-code"">decoupling secret management from source code</a> and using tools such as <a href=""/radar/tools/git-secrets"">git-secrets</a> and <a href=""/radar/tools/talisman"">Talisman</a> to avoid storing secrets in the source code. We've been using <strong>secrets as a service</strong> as a default technique for storing and accessing secrets. With this technique you can use tools such as <a href=""/radar/tools/hashicorp-vault"">Vault</a> or <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/kms/"">AWS Key Management Service (KMS)</a> to read/write secrets over an HTTPS endpoint with fine-grained levels of access control. Secrets as a service uses external identity providers such as <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/iam/"">AWS IAM</a> to identify the actors who request access to secrets. Actors authenticate themselves with the secrets service. For this process to work, it's important to automate bootstrapping the identity of the actors, services and applications.

Chaos Engineering,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"<p>In the last year we have seen <strong>Chaos Engineering</strong> go from being a much talked about idea to an accepted, widely accepted idea to improve and ensure the resiliency of distributed systems. As organizations large and small begin to implement Chaos Engineering as an operational process, we are learning how to safely apply these techniques on a large scale. The approach is definitely not for everyone and to be effective and secure requires large-scale organizational support. Industry acceptance and availability of experts will definitely increase with the advent of commercial services such as <a href=""/radar/tools/gremlin"">Gremlin</a>and deployment tools such as <a href=""/radar/tools/spinnaker"">Spinnaker</a> implementing some Chaos Engineering tools.

Container security scanning,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"<p>The container revolution around <a href=""/radar/platforms/docker"">Docker</a> has massively reduced the friction in moving applications between environments, fueling increased adoption of continuous delivery and continuous deployments. The latter, especially, has blown a rather large hole in the traditional controls over what can go to production. The technique of <strong>container security scanning</strong> is a necessary response to this threat vector. Tools in the build pipeline automatically check containers flowing through the pipeline against known vulnerabilities. Since our first mention of this technique, the tool landscape has matured and the technique has proven useful on development efforts with our clients.</p> "
Service mesh,assess,techniques,FALSE,"<p><strong>Service mesh</strong> is an approach to operating a secure, fast and reliable microservices ecosystem. It has been an important stepping stone in making it easier to adopt microservices at scale. It offers discovery, security, tracing, monitoring and failure handling. It provides these cross-functional capabilities without the need for a shared asset such as an API gateway or baking libraries into each service. A typical implementation involves lightweight reverse-proxy processes, aka sidecars, deployed alongside each service process in a separate container. Sidecars intercept the inbound and outbound traffic of each service and provide cross-functional capabilities mentioned above. This approach has relieved the distributed service teams from building and updating the capabilities that the mesh offers as code in their services. This has lead to an even easier adoption of <a href=""/radar/techniques/polyglot-programming"">polyglot programming</a> in a microservices ecosystem. Our teams have been successfully using this approach with open source projects such as <a href=""/radar/platforms/istio"">Istio</a> and we will continue to monitor other open service mesh implementations such as <a href=""http://linkerd.io/"">Linkerd</a> closely.</p> "
Strong eventual consistency (ACID 2.0),adopt,techniques,TRUE,"<p><b>ACID</b> is an acronym that stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability, characteristics of SQL databases, and that basically guarantee consistency and availability but are not easily distributed or tolerant to partitioning as indicated in the  <a href=""https://grupobancolombia.visualstudio.com/Vicepresidencia%20Servicios%20de%20Tecnología/_wiki/wikis/Vicepresidencia%20Servicios%20de%20Tecnología.wiki/1773/Tipos-de-bases-de-datos"">CAP theorem</a>.

Consistency and effective use of cache,assess,techniques,FALSE,"<p>Distributed in-memory application data caches like memcached are a popular solution for scaling database-driven web sites. These systems are easy to add to existing deployments, and increase performance significantly by reducing load on both the database and application servers. Unfortunately, such caches do not integrate well with the database or the application. They cannot maintain transactional consistency across the entire system, violating the isolation properties of the underlying database. <br>They leave the application responsible for locating data in the cache and keeping it up to date, a frequent source of application complexity and programming errors. <br>Addressing both of these problems, there are options as transactional caches. Some cases shows that adding a transactinoal cache can increase the throughput of a web application by up to 5.2×, only slightly less than a non-transactional cache, showing that consistency does not have to come at the price of performance.<br> Know more reading the article<a href=""https://drkp.net/papers/txcache-osdi10.pdf"">Transactional Consistency and Automatic Management in an Application Data Cache</a>, published by Dan R.

Consistency in transactions and distributed processes,assess,techniques,FALSE,"<p>The concepts of transaction and of data consistency are defined for a distributed system. The cases of partitioned data, where fragments of a file are stored at multiple nodes, and replicated data, where a file is replicated at several nodes, are discussed. It is argued that the distribution and replication of data should be transparent to the programs which use the data. That is, the programming interface should provide location transparency, replica transparency, concurrency transparency, and failure transparency. Techniques for providing such transparencies are abstracted and discussed. <br>By extending the notions of system schedule and system clock to handle multiple nodes, it is shown that a distributed system can be modeled as a single sequential execution sequence. This model is then used to discuss simple techniques for implementing the various forms of transparency. <br>All such systems need to deal with the fact that the data may be concurrently modified on different replicas. Broadly speaking, there are two possible ways of dealing with such data modifications: Strongly consistent replication and Optimistic replication. <br> Know more <a href=""https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/319732.319734"">official paper</a> </p>"
Compensation transactions- Saga pattern,assess,techniques,FALSE,"<p>At very first, Saga pattern was proposed by Hector García-Molina and Kenneth Salem as a sophisticated solution for the Long lived Transactions problem. A LLT is a saga if it can be written as a sequence of transactions that can be interleaved with other transactions The database management system guarantees that either all the transactions m a saga are successfully completed or compensatmg transactions are run to amend a partial execution Both the concept of saga and its lmplementation are relatively simple, but they have the potential to improve performance slgmficantly.

Retry and idempotence,adopt,techniques,FALSE,"<p> Retry is a fairly simple pattern that is useful when you get an unexpected response or no response at all. Simply, it is about the number of retries that an application can execute in order to obtain the expected response for a request. In order for the pattern to be used successfully, the retries must be able to be configured a certain number of times. It is useful when there are network problems, internal errors of the consumed server, because there are no responses or they are very slow. It is useless if the component to consume is overloaded with requests. In Bancolombia, the Retry pattern is not applied alone, it is done in conjunction with <b>Circuit Breaker</b>. It is often useful for some operations that use Retry to be idempotent. <b>Idempotency</b> is a property used in mathematics and computer science, where certain operations can be applied multiple times without changing the result after the first interaction. It is applied in scenarios where the client can make retries on the request and where these can generate untimely changes or damage. Apply Idempotence preferably in relevant operations, as this operation can add latencies, so it is not recommended in all operations. This can be done through the use of <b>idempotence http headers</b>.
